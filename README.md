# Healthcare Accessibiliy in Africa
### 📍 Project Overview
---
This project is centered on healthcare accessibility in Africa.

🔹 Rural vs. Urban Healthcare Disparities: This dataset provides insights into the distribution of healthcare facilities, the number of doctors and nurses, and patient accessibility across different regions. 

🔹 Healthcare Workforce Availability: This dataset includes information on the availability of doctors and nurses per facility and how this varies between urban and rural locations. 

🔹 Patient Accessibility and Utilization: The dataset tracks annual patient visits, average distance to facilities, and emergency response times, helping assess accessibility in different regions. 

🔹 Funding and Resource Allocation: This dataset explores the funding received by healthcare facilities and their access to essential services like electricity and the internet.

🔹 Patient Satisfaction and Healthcare Outcomes: Patient satisfaction rates serve as indicators of service quality, while other factors like emergency response times help evaluate healthcare.

### 📝 Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the following data preparationn phase we perform the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data Cleaning and formatting.
4. Spell check.
5. Standerdization.
6. Data validation.

### 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Which countries have the highest/lowest healthcare accessibility in Africa.
- Is there a correlation between healthcare access and economic indicators.
- What are the disparities between the Urban and Rural healthcare accessibility.

### 🔍 Results/Findings
The analysis results are summarized as follows.
1. The disparities between the Urban and Rural areas according to the dataset shows no much differences in terms of satisfaction to services rendered, timing for an emergency case aswell as the funding efficiency in health centers, hospitals and clinics.
2. Patient satisfaction rates serve as indicators of service quality. 

### 💡 Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Increase Healthcare infrastructure such as building more clinics and hospitals expecially in rural areas.
- Enhance healthcare worker training for better service delivery.
- Ensure availability of medicines.
- Focus on areas with limited healthcare access.
- Engage locaal communities in healthcare planning.
  
### ⚠️ Limitations
Healthcare access is often limited in rural areas than Urban areas.
